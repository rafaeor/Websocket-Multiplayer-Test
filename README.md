## Description

Websocket-Multiplayer-Test is an online game test built using Socket.io in JavaScript. This project was one of my first experiences with JavaScript and Socket.io, and I was amazed at how few lines of code it took to connect two clients into a room.

## How to Use

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/rafaeor/Websocket-Multiplayer.git` in the terminal.
2. Run `cd Websocket-Multiplayer>`
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Open `http://localhost:2000` on your browser.
